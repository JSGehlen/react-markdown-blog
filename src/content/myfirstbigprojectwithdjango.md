title: My first big project with Django

I created an E-Commerce website for a fake coffee company called Django Coffee Co (very clever name, I know)

Back in October 2019, I hadn't written a single line of Django, or Python for that matter, so this was a big challenge for me to build. I've had the idea to build something like this for a long time, but I wanted to take my time and really learn the language.

We used Django at work in Duunitori, so my learning process was relatively easy, since I had excellent co-workers to mentor me along the way.

I quickly realised that learning Django was easier than I thought. This was because it is, all tho an entirely different language, quite similar to ReactJS, where you build components (html template blocks in Django), route them with Router and Switch, (views.py and urls.py in Django) etc.

So this mindset was already familiar to me when I started the learning. Besides using it at work, I also started to read about it at home. I created small projects and slowly learned the workflow. After a spending countless hours reading documentation, watching tutorial videos and taking short courses, I decided that I was finally ready to tackle this challenge of building an E-Commerce store with Django.

Say hello to Django Coffee Co! A coffee package selling online store.

I created it with Django and Bootstrap 4.
The company logo is my design I made with Adobe Illustrator.
Coffee package mockups are from Good Mockups. however I created the design on them using Canva.
Payments are handled with Stripe and/or Paypal
Feel free to give it a try and purchase some items. There is are existing testing-purpose accounts that you can use while testing the website. You will find these by clicking the Login button. If you like to create your own account, feel free to do so and use that account to finish your purchases.

I also created testing accounts for Stripe and PayPal to use for the payment process, so kindly use those. You will find more information along the way with the payment process.

This entire project took about 2-3 months and I am quite happy about how it turned out.

I would really appreciate some feedback about this article and the project itself.

Thanks!

Yours truly,

Jeremy
